WolfAdmin module for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory servers.
Copyright (C) 2015-2017 Timo 'Timothy' Smit

REQUIREMENTS

  * Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory server
  * NoQuarter mod (1.2.7 or higher, maybe 1.2.5 works as well)
  * Lua 5.1 library and Lua modules enabled (installed binaries)
  * A database is required if you want to use advanced history and
    other listings. In this case, the module also requires the corresponding
    LuaSQL binary/module (luasql.sqlite or luasql.mysql).

INSTRUCTIONS (NEW)

  * Unpack the /luascripts folder into /nq/luascripts/wolfadmin
  * Unpack the contents of the /config folder into your /nq directory (or 
    /.etwolf/nq on Linux systems)
  * Optionally, copy the contents of the cvars.cfg to your own server 
    configuration file
  * Modify /nq/wolfadmin.cfg to your needs
  * Modify /nq/shrubbot.cfg to add WolfAdmin specific flags
  * Add /luascripts/wolfadmin/main.lua to the lua_modules cvar
  * Run the .sql script in /database/new on your server:
    - for SQLite3, run wolfadmin_sqlite3.sql in your SQLite3 CLI or manager
    - for MySQL, run wolfadmin_mysql.sql in your MySQL manager
  * Run your server

INSTRUCTIONS (UPGRADE)

  * Unpack the /luascripts folder into your /nq directory
  * Run the .sql script in /database/upgrade/previous-version-here on your 
    server:
    - for SQLite3, run wolfadmin_sqlite3.sql in your SQLite3 CLI or manager
    - for MySQL, run wolfadmin_mysql.sql in your MySQL manager
  * Run your server

INSTRUCTIONS (MENU)

  If you want to use the menu that can be used for the voting, use the
  following instructions.

  * Copy the .pk3 file corresponding to this WolfAdmin version to your 
    /nq directory

TROUBLESHOOTING

  * WolfAdmin config will not get loaded/one of greetings/rules is not loaded
      Make sure that there are two empty lines (containing no spaces) at the 
      end of your .cfg files. Due to the loading mechanism WolfAdmin uses, you 
      have to add these completely empty lines, right at the end. Additionally,
      between two blocks of information you also have to leave an empty line.
      Check the config files in the /config folder for an example.
